# Pollards-Kangaroo-Test-Files
Files to run and test Pollard's Kangaroo ECDLP solver

You can use these files to test different configurations or settings while running the Pollards Kangaroo. I use it while testing different
settings associated with JeanLucPons Kangaroo, found here: https://github.com/JeanLucPons/Kangaroo. The base/stock settings are what you get
when you download Jean Luc's exe file or just compile from source code. If you make changes, its' a good idea to compare it against the same
bits settings.

If you would like different bits, let me know.
